# üìà StockPulse ‚Äì Real-Time Inventory & Order Management System

**StockPulse** is a production-grade backend engineering project that simulates a real-world order and inventory management system built using modern backend technologies. Designed for engineers who want to showcase hands-on expertise with **microservices**, **gRPC**, **Kafka**, **Golang**, **Redis**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **MySQL**.

It now also includes a **React + Tailwind** frontend to visualize and interact with the platform!

## üìå Features

### ‚úÖ Core Services

- **Order Service** (REST)
  - Accepts customer orders
  - Emits `OrderPlaced` Kafka event
  - Stores order in MySQL

- **Inventory Service** (gRPC + Redis)
  - Handles stock checking/reservation
  - Caches product stock in Redis
  - Syncs with MySQL for persistence

- **Kafka Consumer**
  - Listens to `OrderPlaced` events
  - Triggers stock reservation

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (React)

- Order form with product selection
- Shows success/failure responses
- Inventory dashboard (upcoming)
- API connectivity with backend

    B -->|POST /order| C[üì¶ Order Service (REST)]
    C -->|üì§ Kafka Event: OrderPlaced| D[(Kafka Broker)]
    D -->|üì• Consume Event| E[üì¶ Inventory Service (gRPC)]
    E -->|Check Stock + Update| F[(üß† Redis Cache)]
    E -->|Fallback & Persist| G[(üóÑÔ∏è MySQL DB)]
  end

  F -->|Cache Miss| G

### üìù Notes:

- **Frontend** communicates with **Order Service** over REST.
- **Order Service** produces an event to **Kafka** upon successful order placement.
- **Inventory Service** listens to Kafka topic (e.g., `order.placed`) and adjusts stock.
- Inventory cache is maintained in **Redis**, with fallback to **MySQL**.
- All services are containerized and orchestrated via **Docker** / **Kubernetes**.
